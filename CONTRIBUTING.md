## Make sure programs satisfy some of following criteria :-

* Variable names should be descriptive.
* Appropriate data types must be used.
* Programs should be easy to read and understand.
* Try to use simple algorithms and data structures wherever possible.
* Program should be commented liberally.
* Wherever possible try to make modular programs by dividing a large program into several smaller programs.
* Unnecessary instructions and variable should be omitted.
* If possible,program should be optimized to run faster and smaller in size.
